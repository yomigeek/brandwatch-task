#### How can I build a better "Product"
- Implement a sort on UI (sort in either ascending or descending order)
- Implement a topic detail page
- Add like an analytics dashboard to provide insights into the topics


### My current Solution

- Implemented pagination(loads first 10 products, then on click load more , adds 10 more)
- Implemented the topic list table
- Implemented a simulated loader process
- Implemented a not found page for non-existing routes
- Used CSS-IN-JS approach due to the fact it allows for dynamic css values
